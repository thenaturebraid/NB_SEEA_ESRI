    By Shaun Astbury (shaast@ceh.ac.uk) and B Jackson and Keith Miller

    Python script created to utilise the polygon tools module. Generates a grid of
    square-shaped cells of a specified size, from an input polygon extent. The grid
    extent can optionally be aligned to suitable coordinates e.g. 123456 to 123000,
    and have a buffer applied. If a desired cell size is not known, set to zero.

    The output grid will overlap the input extent completely, and as such, if the
    extent is not exactly divisible by the chosen cell size, the extent of the
    output will be slightly larger than that of the input.
